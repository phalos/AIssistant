Comprehensive Scope Document for Kyle Agent Development
Project Overview
Kyle is an AI-powered personal assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man. It aims to provide advanced conversational AI, screen awareness, audio analysis (including guitar note recognition), long-term memory capabilities, and a user-friendly interface. The development process will be divided into three phases: MVP, Phase 1, and Phase 2, with clear feature sets for each phase.

Development Phases
Phase 1: MVP
The MVP focuses on delivering the foundational features required for Kyle to function as a basic AI assistant.

Features:

Basic UI:

Display indicators for when Kyle is listening or speaking.

Allow users to interact via text or voice.

Provide responses in both text and voice (with a mute option).

Long-Term Memory:

Basic memory functionality to track project progress.

Voice Recognition:

Implement high-quality voice recognition tools with hardcoded voice and tone settings.

Screen & Audio Processing:

Basic screen capture using OpenCV.

Audio transcription using Whisper API.

Prompts for Coding Agents:

Set up the project structure (backend, frontend, documentation folders).

Install dependencies (Node.js, Python libraries, Whisper API, OpenCV).

Implement basic API endpoints (/listen, /screen, /respond).

Develop a simple UI prototype using React/Electron.js.

Test audio transcription and screen capture functionalities.

Reminder for Agents:
Update the planning document after completing each task. Ensure all features are tracked and documented for reference.

Phase 2: Core Feature Expansion
This phase builds upon the MVP by enhancing Kyle's functionality and introducing advanced features.

Features:

Improved Long-Term Memory:

Integrate a vector database (Weaviate, Pinecone, or ChromaDB) for efficient storage and retrieval of conversation history.

Enable Kyle to debug its own code over time.

Advanced Voice Customization:

Add dynamic voice selection and tone adjustment capabilities.

Enhanced Screen & Audio Processing:

Optimize screen analysis for better accuracy.

Improve audio processing with noise reduction techniques.

UI Refinements:

Add visual analytics for screen/audio inputs.

Enhance responsiveness and usability.

Prompts for Coding Agents:

Implement vector database integration for memory storage.

Develop dynamic voice selection functionality in the backend.

Refine screen/audio processing algorithms for better performance.

Update the UI with analytics and improved interaction indicators.

Reminder for Agents:
Document all new features in the tracking document. Test each feature thoroughly before marking it as complete.

Phase 3: Advanced Features & Scalability
This phase focuses on scaling Kyle’s capabilities and preparing it for real-world usage.

Features:

Multi-User Support:

Enable authentication and personalized profiles for multiple users.

Voice Synthesis:

Implement natural voice synthesis using advanced tools (e.g., OpenAI.fm).

Scalability Enhancements:

Containerize the application using Docker.

Deploy backend to cloud services like AWS or DigitalOcean.

UI Improvements:

Add customization options for users to personalize Kyle’s interface.

Prompts for Coding Agents:

Develop multi-user authentication in the backend.

Integrate voice synthesis tools into the response generation pipeline.

Optimize deployment pipelines with Docker and cloud hosting services.

Create customization options within the UI.

Reminder for Agents:
Ensure scalability features are well-documented in the tracking document. Conduct real-world testing to gather feedback before finalizing this phase.
